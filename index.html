                                                  Socks were the second item I learned how to knit, after a basic garter knit scarf. My simple brain thought that because socks are small they would be easy. That is, obviously, not the case. They are knitted in 4ply (a fine yarn) on a small circular needle which means youâ€™re doing far more stitches per inch than you would for a chunky jumper or a scarf. They are also fairly complicated â€“ I went from only knowing how to knit in a straight line to knowing how to heel turn, pick up stitches, decrease stitches, rib, and bind off with a kitchener stitch.

                                          <br><br>I actually think socks are a great project to get into knitting, because with these tools I feel like I can now tackle whatever I fancy. I also love how lightweight they are for travelling around with â€“ they kept me busy on the many long train journeys I took last year. I now always have a pair of socks on the go alongside whatever bigger project Iâ€™m working on at home.

                                          <br><br>A grower Iâ€™m working with here has just had a baby, so I decided to use some leftover yarn to make this tiny pair of socks. I used the Winwick Mum Sockalong tutorial <a href="https://www.winwickmum.co.uk/">(https://www.winwickmum.co.uk/)</a> and just scaled down the size to 32 stitches. Itâ€™s an amazing tutorial which walks you through every step with pictures and videos. 

                                          <br><br>I used a 2.5mm circular Addi needle, with West Yorkshire Spinners Signature 4 Ply yarn in the Goldfinch colourway. As I'm writing this, I'm looking out the window and there's a Goldfinch perched right outside. I've only just started learning bird species and this is the first Goldfinch I've ever recognised, so a lovely coincidence to put that and the colourway together :)  Itâ€™s a  wool nylon mix, self-striping and machine washable. I love this range, itâ€™s really affordable British wool with beautiful colours and super easy/consistent to work with.

                                          Itâ€™s May and Iâ€™ve been fairly switched off from the mushroom world for a while now. Iâ€™ve had the spring wildflowers to keep me occupied, and itâ€™s a quiet time for fungi. But I spotted a Dryadâ€™s Saddle on some hard wood this weekend and suddenly feel excited for the coming season. Dryadâ€™s Saddle is best picked when young, as it gets too leathery to eat as it ages. Iâ€™d already climbed a huge slope and stung myself about 20 times to get hold of this, so I wasnâ€™t giving up when I realised it wasnâ€™t worth eating the flesh. 
                                          <br><br>I chopped it up and boiled it for a couple of hours with onion and carrot, then strained and stored the liquid in the fridge. A few days later I used the broth with added soy sauce and lemon as a base to make a kind of ramen (not really ramen if weâ€™re being pedantic, I used thicker udon noodles which are my favourite). The greens are all from here â€“ asparagus and chive flowers picked from the farm, spinach from my garden plot. The egg is also from farm chickens and I pickled the carrots.
                                          <br><br>My verdict wasâ€¦ generally mushroomy. Which is always a good thing in my mind, but not the most exciting. I didnâ€™t notice anything distinctive about the broth, but it could have been because I got overexcited about the toppings which distracted from it. My biggest lesson for ramen is to try keep it simple and focus on the soup.

                            <h5 id=date>9th May 2020</h5>
                            <div class=photo><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49876167812_55a9e13be8_b.jpg" style="height:250px"/></div>

                                <div class=panel>
                                  <p class= content> 
                                    Calendula oil was my first foray into using flowers/herbs for skincare. We grew them in the polytunnel in big numbers on the Lancaster community farm - they are a great trap to attract aphids away from the valuable crops. They also bring beneficial insects inside with their vibrant orange display, a quality which makes them one of my favourite cut flowers. 
                                    <br><br> After a bit of research I found out the flower is also hypo-allergenic with a bunch of skin-healing properties (I really love this plant), and as someone who suffers with sensitive skin and acne I decided to try making some oil. 
                                    <br><br>I picked a bag of flowerheads and then left them to dry on a sunny windowsill for about 2 weeks, until they were papery. I then removed the petals and put them in a disinfected jar, completely covering them with almond oil (maybe mixed with some olive oil to keep the cost down for a budget student). I left it on the windowsill for another ~6 weeks so the petals could infuse, shaking the jar whenever I remembered. Some instructions tell you to put the jar in a paper bag to avoid the beneficial bits breaking down from sunlight, but I didnâ€™t do this, mostly just because I liked looking at it ðŸ˜Š 
                                    <br><br>Finally I strained the petals out, and have been using a few drops directly on my face, or mixing it with soaked oats to make a calming face mask. I think itâ€™ll take more than a good healing oil to fix my skin, which is a long-term issue. But I like to think it does some good.
