                                      Choosing what to knit in Spring can be a predicament. Jumpers are out the question, and I wouldnâ€™t have the satisfaction of wearing any wooly hats or scarves for months to come. Last year I think I just powered through several socks, but this year I thought Iâ€™d try out using wool for summer clothes and knitted up this tank top. 
                                      <br><br>Me and my mum went to the Farnham Yarn Festival back in February, and whilst I loved browsing, when youâ€™re about to become a volunteer for 7 months you canâ€™t really splash out. Feeling a bit sad about all the projects I could imagine but couldnâ€™t afford, right at the end I finally found a discounted shade of <a href="https://baaramewe.co.uk/products/winterburnaran?_pos=1&_sid=81b2e52b4&_ss=r&variant=8672316686387"> Baa Ram Eweâ€™s Aran wool </a>. The shade, â€˜Muckâ€™ seemed fitting for where I was about to move to and I picked up a couple of skeins.     
                                      <br><br>I used an online pattern from Ravelry, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/beach-tank">Mild Womanâ€™s Beach Tank </a>. It was a really quick and easy knit, just working plain in the round, but I did learn how to make an l-cord strap for the first time. I was worried about the sizing as I donâ€™t usually fit a standard small or medium top, and it did need a little adjusting for tightness. But generally I like the style. Wool might seem like a strange choice for summer and itâ€™s a bit warm, but itâ€™s actually a really good material for wicking away sweat. Iâ€™m happy with it, and will definitely get on with more summer clothing when Iâ€™ve saved up some pennies.

                                            Last month I learned that you can eat fresh pine needle tips in Spring, and it sparked a bit of an obsession. The taste combines two of my favourite things, citrus and Christmas, and I rushed to find out everything you can possibly do with them. 
                                            <br><br>My favourite recipe was pine tip and peanut butter cookies, from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fnexFH-Qr/">theforagerchef</a> on Instagram. The flavours balanced perfectly and they went down really well with everyone on the farm. I also finely chopped some (a blender would have worked better but thatâ€™s a luxury I donâ€™t have yet) and preserved them in sugar for later use in baking. All pine tips are edible except those from the yew tree, and I used what I thiiiink is Scots Pine for the cookies. 
                                            <br><br>THEN I saw my favourite Youtuber Marina make a lovely basket out of long pine needles in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6BfrG8IFk0">this video</a>. You are supposed to use needles at least 5 inches or longer, otherwise it becomes really fiddly to work with. Unfortunately, after much searching I found out that I didnâ€™t have any long-needled pines nearby. I had my mind set on it by this point though, so I settled for a Corsican Pine tree with about 4 inch needles and tried my best. It resulted in a teeny tiny basket and took several hours, but it fits my jewellery and makes me happy ðŸ˜Š itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve done any sort of basket weaving and Iâ€™m looking forward to doing more, on a much bigger scale. Thereâ€™s plenty of willow about here, so I might go for that more conventional material next time. 
                                            <br>Oh, I also didnâ€™t have any raffia/twine to weave with, so I used some of my black charcoal dental floss instead. Maybe a little strange but it worked surprisingly well, and I donâ€™t hate the colour contrast.
