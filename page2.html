                                            I discovered last month that you can eat fresh pine needle tips in Spring, and it sparked a bit of an obsession. They mix two of my favourite things, citrus and the scent of Christmas, and I rushed to find out everything you can possibly do with them. 
                                            <br><br>My favourite recipe was pine tip and peanut butter cookies, from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chefstevethompson/">theforagerchef</a> on Instagram. The flavours balanced perfectly and they went down really well with everyone on the farm. I also finely chopped some (a blender would have worked better but thatâ€™s a luxury I donâ€™t have yet) and preserved them in sugar for later use in baking. All pine tips are edible except those from the yew tree, and I used what I thiiiink is Scots Pine for the cookies. 
                                            <br><br>THEN I saw my favourite Youtuber Marina make a lovely basket out of long pine needles in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6BfrG8IFk0">this video</a>. You are supposed to use needles at least 5 inches or longer, otherwise it becomes really fiddly to work with. Unfortunately, after much searching I found out that I didnâ€™t have any long-needled pines nearby. I had my mind set on it by this point though, so I settled for a Corsican Pine tree with about 4 inch needles and tried my best. It resulted in a teeny tiny basket and took several hours, but it fits my jewellery and makes me happy ðŸ˜Š itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve done any sort of basket weaving and Iâ€™m looking forward to doing more, on a much bigger scale. Thereâ€™s plenty of willow about here, so I might go for that more conventional material next time. 
                                            <br>Oh, I also didnâ€™t have any raffia/twine to weave with, so I used some of my black charcoal dental floss instead. Maybe a little strange but it worked surprisingly well, and I donâ€™t hate the colour contrast.
