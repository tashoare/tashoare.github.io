        <p>I love to knit and forage, and at the moment I’m becoming more interested in baking, crochet and painting. Basically, I love to create stuff. This website is a space to document some of the things I’ve been making, perhaps to share or just to remember later.
         <br><br> I also wanted to test whether I could make a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I did a short course with CodeFirst Girls in 2018 which was a lot of fun, but it’s hard to make things stick and I found by 2020 I’d forgotten all the computer language. So this is me re-learning and seeing what I can do.
